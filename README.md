# FacebookGroupScraper
Created this tool to extract member information from a Facebook group to assist club alumni relations. FacebookScraper.py contains a scraper class which collects member names and join dates, then stores them into respective Lists. DataExtractor.py utilizes Pandas to store the List data into a properly labelled DataFrame. That DataFrame is then sent to a Google Sheet through Google APIs.
